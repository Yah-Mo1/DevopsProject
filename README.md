# DevopsProject


```bash

1. Create 2 modules in Terraform that can create a webapp that runs nginx (on a Virtual Machine) and a module for a Vnet (add all required parts such as NatGW, route tables and everything else).
Using AWS/Azure.
Using correct folder/directory strategy. Make sure you can access the site after (figure out how to do this)
2. Make sure the modules work and you can run on 3 different environments like prod, dev and staging.
3. Create a CICD pipeline to run your Terraform workflow (ideally with GitHub Actions) but you can use GitLab pipelines or even Jenkins if you want.
4. Make sure you use env vars for any credentials. I don't want to see any hardcoding of credentials.

```
